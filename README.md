# -Carbon-Permits-Twitter-Sentiment
This project seeks to investigate whether there exists a statistically significant relationship between the price of EUA futures and intraday Twitter sentiment, while controlling for the energy market (coal, crude oil Brent, natural gas NBP) and broad equity market (FTSE 100 and the XLE). It will illustrate that negative and positive aspects of public mood carry improved power to explain and track movements of EUA futures, which in turn has implications for day traders, policymakers, financial researchers, and financial regulators.
